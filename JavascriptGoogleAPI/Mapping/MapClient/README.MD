
Charlie, 

I re-visited & re-submitted my Midterm01 after cleaning it up and examining it.
I hoped that it would give me more clarity on this jQueryMobile stuff... that's why I spent
some of my precious remaining time on it.  

I have been "the build guy" at organizations, so I am fairly well-versed in scripts etc.  So I chose 
to use what little time I have left working on my mobile app, instead of my website uploading automation.  I 
just thought I would get more out of that experience.  

My goodness... that .ajax call not working cost me literally 12 hours.  I just never thought to even try
the other rendition of it.  And last weekend I was out of town Sat/Sun, and had agreed to help out a friend
on Monda the 11th.  So after the Thursday (the 7th) when you said, "You guys are not gonna like me...." I lost 72 
hours of potential programming time.  That's PART of the reason I'm so behind [AGAIN].  

It's very disappointing to me... because I really still feel I need more understanding of the jQueryMobile, 
and the Cordova layout.  I really coulda used those 12 hours to make a LOT of progress!  




So having said that, here is what else is going on in here:

1)  ONE NOTE: I worked through the server code BEFORE I added it to this repository.
(That's why there are no mods showing in that Mapping/MapServer code.)
That repo address is in GitHub: git@github.com:grizzlycraig/PROG272_Week10_02.git

2) I cannot figure out for the life of me, how to AVOID having my "page 1" and "page 2" buttons NOT appear
floating over my "directions" div after I click the "Get Directions" button.  This was probably an hour or 
more trying to nail down.

3) I fixed it so when you add a new city, it automatically checks that radio box for you.

4)  I have NO UNIT TESTS.  I have NO SCRIPTING for uploading/copying to the site.  I have NO MARKING
ability... it took me only a few minutes to get the GeoCode into the Cordova app... but I did NOT 
quite understand how the marking was supposed to work so I didn't work on it at all.  
I have NO ADDITIONAL WEBSITE using jQuery.  (There is an old nasty Page 3 leftover in my MapClient.)
I have NO Apache install.  I didn't even look at the scripts.  


I am OUT of time.  [It is "tomorrow" now....]  I have got to get some sleep.  I am looking forward to 
taking PROG282 next quarter.  This quarter has been vastly infuriating, very painful, incredibly overwhelming
at times.  I feel that there is soooo much more to learn.  

BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU CHARLIE:  I am between jobs, now, and have been questioning whether to target
testing jobs, or programming jobs.  This class has single-handedly REMINDED ME that I want to work as a 
programmer.  As vexing and frustrating and agonizing as it could be, there is a LOT of REALLY REALLY COOL
stuff out there.  And this is what I live to do.  I am a good tester, and a great debugger, but it is in 
the creation of software objects out of the ether that truly defines my Bliss.  Thank you for that reminder!


MY REPO IS:  git clone git@bitbucket.org:grizzlycraig/prog272myfinalv1.git
